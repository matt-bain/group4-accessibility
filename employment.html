        <h2>Employment</h2>
        <p>Accessibility of employment covers a wide range of issues, from skills training, to occupational therapy, finding employment, and retaining employment.</p>
        <p>Employment rates for workers with disabilities are lower than for the general workforce. Workers in Western countries fare relatively well, having access to more services and training as well as legal protections against employment discrimination. Despite this, in the United States the 2012 unemployment rate for workers with disabilities was 12.9%, while it was 7.3% for workers without disabilities. More than half of workers with disabilities (52%) earned less than $25,000 in the previous year, compared with just 38% of workers with no disabilities. This translates into an earnings gap where individuals with disabilities earn about 25 percent less of what workers without disabilities earn.Among occupations with 100,000 or more people, dishwashers had the highest disability rate (14.3%), followed by refuse and recyclable material collectors (12.7%), personal care aides (11.9%), and janitors and building cleaners (11.8%). The rates for refuse and recyclable material collectors, personal care aides, and janitors and building cleaners were not statistically different from one another.</p>
        <p>Surveys of non-Western countries are limited, but the available statistics also indicate fewer jobs being filled by workers with disabilities. In India, a large 1999 survey found that "of the 'top 100 multinational companies' in the country [...] the employment rate of persons with disabilities in the private sector was a mere 0.28%, 0.05% in multinational companies and only 0.58% in the top 100 IT companies in the country". India, like much of the world, has large sections of the economy that are without strong regulation or social protections, such as the informal economy. Other factors have been cited as contributing to the high unemployment rate, such as public service regulations. Although employment for workers with disabilities is higher in the public sector due to hiring programs targeting persons with disabilities, regulations currently restrict types of work available to persons with disabilities: "Disability-specific employment reservations are limited to the public sector and a large number of the reserved positions continue to be vacant despite nearly two decades of enactment of the PWD Act".</p>
        <p>Expenses related to adaptive or assistive technology required to participate in the workforce may be tax deductible expenses for individuals with a medical practitioner's prescription in some jurisdictions.</p>

        <h3>Meeting and conference access</h3>
        <p>Meetings and conferences should consider the needs of all of their participants. Checklists such as this may make it easier to identify specific needs:</p>
        <h4>Mobility access</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Wheelchair accessible transportation - see Persons with reduced mobility</li>
          <li>Reserved parking</li>
          <li>Barrier-free meeting rooms / restrooms / podium/speaker's platform</li>
          <li>ADA Compliant Ramp Access to businesses and public places</li>
          <li>Accessible lodging</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Hearing access</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Advance copies of papers</li>
          <li>An assistive listening system</li>
          <li>Sign language interpreters</li>
          <li>A quiet place to gather for social conversation (a quieter space that is still visible to others should be reserved at social events or dinners so that people who are hard of hearing may go there to talk with their colleagues.)</li>
          <li>TTY access or Internet-based TRS</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Full access</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Large print/braille copies of the program and papers</li>
          <li>A student volunteer to guide and describe the artwork, computer work, etc.</li>
          <li>A tech to help with assistive devices and screen readers (e.g., JAWS)</li>
          <li>Gloves to touch three dimensional work (where permissible)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Other issues</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Notification if social events include flashing lights and noises (these can cause seizures, so either avoid them or announce them ahead of time).</li>
          <li>Notices asking participants to refrain from allergy-producing problems (e.g., perfumes)</li>
          <li>Inform food providers of food allergies (e.g., peanuts, shellfish, etc.)</li>
          <li>Referral information for local personal care attendant agencies</li>
          <li>Referral information for veterinarian care for service animals</li>
          <li>Access to a place to rest during the day (if the conference venue is far from the lodgings)</li>
        </ul>
