          <p>Assistive technology is the creation of a new device that assists a person in completing a task that would otherwise be impossible. Some examples include new computer software programs like screen readers, and inventions such as
            assistive
            listening devices, including hearing aids, and traffic lights with a standard color code that enables colorblind individuals to understand the correct signal.</p>

          <p>Adaptive technology is the modification, or adaptation, of existing devices, methods, or the creation of new uses for existing devices, to enable a person to complete a task. Examples include the use of remote controls, and the
            autocomplete
            (word completion) feature in computer word processing programs, which both help individuals with mobility impairments to complete tasks. Adaptations to wheelchair tires are another example; widening the tires enables wheelchair users to
            move
            over soft surfaces, such as deep snow on ski hills, and sandy beaches.</p>

          <p>Assistive technology and adaptive technology have a key role in developing the means for people with disabilities to live more independently, and to more fully participate in mainstream society. In order to have access to assistive or
            adaptive technology, however, educating the public and even legislating requirements to incorporate this technology have been necessary.</p>
